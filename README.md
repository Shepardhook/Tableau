üìä Telecommunications Outage Analysis Dashboard
This project presents a streamlined Tableau dashboard built to analyze telecommunications outage data with performance in mind.

üîç Custom Dataset Creation
The dataset was manually constructed based on real-world interview scenarios and synthesized outage patterns in the telecom industry. This allowed for full control over data quality and structure to support efficient reporting.

üßπ Data Cleaning with Python & Jupyter
The raw dataset was cleaned and prepared using Python in Jupyter Notebooks, incorporating:

Pandas for preprocessing and transformations

Statistical techniques for anomaly detection and outlier handling

Lightweight ML models to identify and smooth unusual patterns

This approach ensured a clean and insightful dataset that supports effective visualization and analysis.

‚öôÔ∏è Performance Tuning in Tableau
A key focus of this dashboard is performance tuning‚Äîoptimizing Tableau's speed and responsiveness for large datasets. Techniques implemented:

FIXED Level of Detail (LOD) Expressions: Used to pre-aggregate data at key levels, reducing the load during runtime.

Context Filters: Applied to limit the scope of data before any dependent filters execute, significantly reducing query volume.

These methods collectively eliminate the dreaded ‚Äúloading circle,‚Äù providing a supercharged user experience.

üéØ Purpose
This simplified report was intentionally designed to:

Highlight best practices in Tableau performance optimization

Provide a reference for using FIXED LODs and Context Filters effectively

Serve as a teaching tool for new developers and data analysts
